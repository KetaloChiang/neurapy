Simple interactive graphical toy that lets you design iir filters based on different algorithms. It illustrates when algorithms have a hard time matching requirements, when filter order shoots up and what passband/stopband characteristics look like. Dumps the filter coefficients to your workspace so you can use the designed filters in your scripts.
